Because these metrics were recorded before any letters were sent, any clear differences would suggest an issue in how participants were randomly assigned.\nBaseline variables examined\n- hpa – Highest previous contribution (signals donor capacity)\n- mrm2 – Months since last donation (gauges recency)\n- freq – Number of prior gifts (tracks engagement)\n- female – Gender indicator (checks demographic balance)\nI ran two-sample t tests to see if the treatment and control group means differed. Formally, the t statistic measures how far apart the two group averages are, relative to the variability within each group:\n[ t = ]\nwhere (X_T) and (X_C) are the group means, (S_T^2) and (S_C^2) the sample variances, and (N_T), (N_C) the group sizes.\n\n\nShow code for t-tests\nimport numpy as np\nT, C = df[df.treatment==1], df[df.treatment==0]\n\ndef t_row(x, y):\n    n1,n2 = len(x),len(y)\n    m1,m2 = x.mean(),y.mean()\n    se = np.sqrt(x.var(ddof=1)/n1 + y.var(ddof=1)/n2)\n    t  = (m1-m2)/se\n    return m1, m2, m1-m2, t\n\nrows = [t_row(T[v], C[v]) for v in [\"hpa\",\"mrm2\",\"freq\",\"female\"]]\nttest = pd.DataFrame(\n    rows,\n    columns=[\"Mean T\",\"Mean C\",\"Diff\",\"t-stat\"],\n    index=[\"hpa\",\"mrm2\",\"freq\",\"female\"]\n).round(2)\n\nttest\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-sample t-tests (Treatment − Control)\n\n\n\nMean T\nMean C\nDiff\nt-stat\n\n\n\n\nhpa\n59.60\n58.96\n0.64\n0.97\n\n\nmrm2\n13.01\n13.00\n0.01\n0.12\n\n\nfreq\n8.04\n8.05\n-0.01\n-0.11\n\n\nfemale\n0.28\n0.28\n-0.01\n-1.77\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone of the four |t| values surpassed the usual 1.96 cutoff for a 5% significance level. In fact:\n\nhpa differs by only $0.64 on a $60 baseline—roughly a 1% gap, t = 0.97.\n\nmrm2 and freq are nearly identical (|t| &lt; 0.15).\n\nfemale shows the biggest difference, but |–1.77| is still below 1.96, so at an 8% significance level it’s borderline at best, and any apparent effect fades when adjusting for multiple comparisons.\n\nIn practical terms, treatment and control groups are alike in giving capacity, donation recency, engagement history, and gender composition. This aligns with Table 1 of Karlan & List (2007), confirming the randomization worked as intended. Since the baseline is balanced, any differences in donation behavior later on can be viewed as causal impacts of the match offer, rather than quirks of how participants were assigned.\nNext I replicate the same check with simple linear regression, which yields identical t statistics and reinforces this conclusion.\n\n\nShow code for OLS check\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\ndef ols_coef(v):\n    m = smf.ols(f\"{v} ~ treatment\", data=df).fit()\n    return m.params[\"treatment\"], m.tvalues[\"treatment\"]\nols = pd.DataFrame(\n        [ols_coef(v) for v in [\"hpa\",\"mrm2\",\"freq\",\"female\"]],\n        columns=[\"Coef\",\"t-stat\"], index=[\"hpa\",\"mrm2\",\"freq\",\"female\"]).round(2)\nols\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOLS regression (coef on Treatment)\n\n\n\nCoef\nt-stat\n\n\n\n\nhpa\n0.64\n0.94\n\n\nmrm2\n0.01\n0.12\n\n\nfreq\n-0.01\n-0.11\n\n\nfemale\n-0.01\n-1.76\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe manual two-sample t tests and our quick OLS regressions yield nearly identical t-statistics for each baseline variable (see the tables above). This aligns perfectly with theory: with a single 0/1 predictor, OLS replicates the standard two-sample t test.\nSince all |t| values remain well under the 1.96 threshold, we fail to reject the null hypothesis of equal means for hpa (giving capacity), mrm2 (donation recency), freq (engagement frequency), and female (gender). In simpler terms, the treatment and control groups start off the same.\nThis balance check validates the random assignment. It indicates that any differences observed later in donation behavior can be attributed to the matching-grant offer, rather than artifacts of who ended up in each group."

    "text": "Experimental Results\n\nCharitable Contribution Made\nThe first outcome measures whether each recipient donated at all. If matching grants effectively reduce the “price” of giving, the treatment group should naturally include more donors than the control group.\nWe begin by examining the share of recipients in each group who made a contribution, to see whether mentioning the matching grant drove more individuals to give.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerely mentioning that a leadership donor would match contributions prompted around one in five additional donors to respond. As the chart suggests, this difference is not just random fluctuation—it reflects a genuine behavioral response to the match offer.\nWhile the bar chart indicates that the match letter nudged more people to donate, a visual inspection alone doesn’t confirm statistical significance. To determine whether the 0.4 percentage-point increase is meaningful rather than chance, we:\n\nCompute a two-sample t statistic—the same technique used in our balance check, now applied to the binary outcomegave.\n\nRun the simplest regression, a single-predictor linear probability model (gave ~ treatment). By design, its t-statistic aligns with the manual test, but showing both methods assures transparency.\nCompare our findings to Table 2a, Panel A of Karlan & List (2007) to validate the replication.\n\nIf these tests yield small p-values—matching the original study’s results, we can be confident that simply mentioning a matching grant increases the fraction of donors.\n\n\nShow code for t-test & OLS\nimport numpy as np, pandas as pd, statsmodels.formula.api as smf, scipy.stats as st\n\n# Split groups\nT = df[df.treatment == 1][\"gave\"]\nC = df[df.treatment == 0][\"gave\"]\n\n# Manual two-sample t\ndiff  = T.mean() - C.mean()\nse    = np.sqrt(T.var(ddof=1)/len(T) + C.var(ddof=1)/len(C))\ntstat = diff / se\np_t   = 2 * (1 - st.t.cdf(abs(tstat), df=len(df)-2))\n\n# OLS regression\nols   = smf.ols(\"gave ~ treatment\", data=df).fit()\n\n# Collect results\ntbl = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"Method\": [\"t-test\", \"OLS\"],\n    \"Diff (%-points)\": [diff*100, ols.params[\"treatment\"]*100],\n    \"t / t-stat\": [tstat, ols.tvalues[\"treatment\"]],\n    \"p-value\": [p_t, ols.pvalues[\"treatment\"]]\n}).round(3)\n\ntbl\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of any match on donation probability\n\n\n\nMethod\nDiff (%-points)\nt / t-stat\np-value\n\n\n\n\n0\nt-test\n0.418\n3.209\n0.001\n\n\n1\nOLS\n0.418\n3.101\n0.002\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecipients who knew their gifts would be matched were noticeably more inclined to donate compared to those who received the standard letter. This difference is unlikely to be due to chance: both a straightforward comparison and a quick regression reach the same conclusion. In other words, simply pointing out a matching opportunity nudges a significant number of recipients from “maybe later” to “yes, I’ll give,” in line with what Karlan & List originally reported.\nEconomists sometimes prefer a probit model for 0/1 outcomes because it naturally constrains predicted probabilities between 0 and 1. Applying the exact model from Table 3 (column 1) of Karlan & List—probit with a single treatment indicator—yields the same overall message:\n\n\nShow probit with marginal effect\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nfrom statsmodels.discrete.discrete_model import Probit\n\n# Fit the probit\nprobit_mod = Probit(df[\"gave\"], sm.add_constant(df[\"treatment\"])).fit(disp=False)\n\n# Average marginal effect (overall)\name = probit_mod.get_margeff(at=\"overall\").summary_frame()\name.round(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage marginal effect (matches Table 3, col 1 exactly)\n\n\n\ndy/dx\nStd.

A simple average comparison, a linear regression, and a probit model all reveal a small but meaningful lift—from just under two donors per hundred to just over two. This modest yet consistent effect aligns with Karlan & List’s original findings, showing that the mention of a matching grant successfully encourages a noticeable fraction of otherwise hesitant donors to contribute.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I explore how different match ratios—1:1, 2:1, and 3:1—affect donor response rates.\nSo far, I’ve grouped all match offers together. In reality, donors received three distinct “price discounts,” so the natural question is whether a higher match multiplier translates into higher participation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonation share within each match ratio\n\n\n\nShare who gave\npercent\n\n\nratio\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\nNaN\nnan %\n\n\n1:1\n0.020749\n2.1 %\n\n\n2:1\n0.022633\n2.3 %\n\n\n3:1\n0.022733\n2.3 %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPair-wise t-tests show no meaningful increase. Moving from a 1:1 to a 2:1 match raises the response rate by only 0.2 percentage points—far from the 1.96 threshold for conventional significance (t ≈ 1.0). The shift from 1:1 to 3:1 is similarly small and insignificant, and the comparison between 2:1 and 3:1 is essentially zero. These findings match Karlan & List’s own observation that “larger match ratios do not appear to matter much” (2007, p. 8). In other words, once donors know a match exists, raising the multiplier from 1:1 to 3:1 does not yield extra participation.\nTo verify these pairwise t-tests all at once, I ran a linear probability model that includes a separate indicator for each match ratio. Using 1:1 as the intuitive benchmark, the coefficients on 2:1 and 3:1 tells whether richer multipliers entice more donors.\n\n\nShow regression code\nimport pandas as pd, statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n\n# keep only letters that actually offered a match\nmt  = df[df.treatment == 1].copy()\n\n# make a clean 1/0 dummy for each ratio\nmt[\"ratio1\"] = (mt[\"ratio\"] == 1).astype(int)\n# ratio2 and ratio3 already exist as 1/0 flags in the data\n\n# OLS without an intercept so each coef = group mean\nreg = smf.ols(\"gave ~ ratio1 + ratio2 + ratio3 - 1\", data=mt).fit()\nreg.summary2().tables[1].round(4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear probability model by match ratio (treatment arm only)\n\n\n\nCoef.\nStd.Err.\nt\nP&gt;|t|\n[0.025\n0.975]\n\n\n\n\nratio1\n0.0207\n0.0014\n14.9122\n0.0\n0.0180\n0.0235\n\n\nratio2\n0.0226\n0.0014\n16.2671\n0.0\n0.0199\n0.0254\n\n\nratio3\n0.0227\n0.0014\n16.3354\n0.0\n0.0200\n0.0255\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach coefficient represents the donation rate for that match tier (since we dropped the intercept).\n\n1:1 yields roughly 2.07% of letters converting to donations.\n2:1 bumps that to 2.26%.\n3:1 lands at 2.27%.\n\nThe standard errors hover around 0.14 percentage points, so a 0.2 pp difference is well within one standard error. Formally, the t-stat for 2:1 minus 1:1 is about 0.6, and 3:1 vs. 2:1 is even smaller.\nThe very small p-values in the table refer to how precisely each mean is estimated (due to large N), not to any difference between the tiers themselves.\n\nHigher match ratios nudge the estimate upward by a fraction, but the change is too small relative to sampling variability to be considered reliable. In practice, a simple 1:1 match accounts for nearly the entire increase in participation. Upping the multiplier to 2:1 or 3:1 does not produce a statistically significant rise in donors—consistent with the authors’ remark on page 8.\nI quantified the gap by calculating the differences two ways: directly from the raw data and by subtracting the fitted coefficients from our model.\n\n\nShow code for response-rate differences\nimport numpy as np, pandas as pd\n\n# --- direct from data ---\nr1 = df[(df.treatment==1) & (df.ratio==1)][\"gave\"].mean()\nr2 = df[(df.treatment==1) & (df.ratio==2)][\"gave\"].mean()\nr3 = df[(df.treatment==1) & (df.ratio==3)][\"gave\"].mean()\n\ndirect = pd.Series({\n    \"2:1 − 1:1\": (r2 - r1) * 100,\n    \"3:1 − 2:1\": (r3 - r2) * 100\n})\n\n# --- from regression coefficients (reg from previous chunk) ---\ncoef = reg.params        # ratio1, ratio2, ratio3 means\nreg_diff = pd.Series({\n    \"2:1 − 1:1\": (coef[\"ratio2\"] - coef[\"ratio1\"]) * 100,\n    \"3:1 − 2:1\": (coef[\"ratio3\"] - coef[\"ratio2\"]) * 100\n})\n\npd.DataFrame({\n    \"Difference (pp) direct\": direct.round(2),\n    \"Difference (pp) from reg\": reg_diff.round(2)\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference (pp) direct\nDifference (pp) from reg\n\n\n\n\n2:1 − 1:1\n0.19\n0.19\n\n\n3:1 − 2:1\n0.01\n0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven under close inspection, these gaps remain small:\n\nGoing from 1:1 to 2:1 delivers only a 0.19 percentage-point increase, which is well within the ±0.14 pp margin of error.\nShifting from 2:1 to 3:1 moves the needle by 0.01 pp—effectively zero.\n\nWhether measuring the differences directly or via regression coefficients, the conclusion is the same: richer match ratios do not generate a meaningful uptick in donors. The real boost comes from the presence of a match, not the size of it. For fundraisers, this suggests a straightforward 1:1 offer captures almost the full benefit without requiring the lead donor to fund a higher multiplier.\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nOur earlier analysis focused on whether a person decides to give at all. Now, we turn to whether the match letter also influences the total dollars raised.\nFirst, we treat every solicitation equally—including those that resulted in no donations. Under this approach, a match offer raises average revenue by about 15 cents per letter compared to the standard appeal. Although that’s roughly a 20% increase on an 81-cent baseline, the statistical significance is borderline, with the probability of seeing such a gap by chance hovering just above the 5% threshold. In other words, the rise in per-letter revenue seems mainly driven by converting more non-donors, yet the total lift remains modest and only marginally significant.\n\n\nShow code for unconditional amount\nimport pandas as pd, statsmodels.formula.api as smf, scipy.stats as st, numpy as np\n\n# raw means\nmean_control = df.loc[df.treatment == 0, \"amount\"].mean()\nmean_treat   = df.loc[df.treatment == 1, \"amount\"].mean()\n\n# t-test\nc = df[df.treatment == 0][\"amount\"]\nt = df[df.treatment == 1][\"amount\"]\nse = np.sqrt(c.var(ddof=1)/len(c) + t.var(ddof=1)/len(t))\ntstat = (t.mean() - c.mean()) / se\np_val = 2 * (1 - st.t.cdf(abs(tstat), df=len(df) - 2))\n\n# OLS check\nols_un = smf.ols(\"amount ~ treatment\", data=df).fit()\n\npd.DataFrame({\n    \"Mean ($) Control\": [mean_control.round(2)],\n    \"Mean ($) Treatment\": [mean_treat.round(2)],\n    \"Diff ($)\": [(mean_treat-mean_control).round(2)],\n    \"t-stat\": [round(tstat, 2)],\n    \"p-value\": [round(p_val, 3)]\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage dollars per letter\n\n\n\nMean ($) Control\nMean ($) Treatment\nDiff ($)\nt-stat\np-value\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.81\n0.97\n0.15\n1.92\n0.055\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we isolate people who already decided to donate to see if the match offer encouraged bigger gifts. Among those who opened their wallets, the match group’s average gift is around $43.9 versus $45.5 in the control—a difference of only $1.7, which is well within normal variation (its p-value is comfortably above common significance levels). Since this comparison involves a subset that the match treatment itself helped shape, it’s more descriptive than causal; the random assignment no longer ensures the donors in each group have similar traits. Overall, the clear story is that matching nudges more people to give but does not substantially increase average contributions among those who were already inclined to donate.\n\n\nShow code for conditional amount\ndonors = df[df.gave == 1].copy()\n\nmean_c = donors.loc[donors.treatment == 0, \"amount\"].mean()\nmean_t = donors.loc[donors.treatment == 1, \"amount\"].mean()\n\nols_con = smf.ols(\"amount ~ treatment\", data=donors).fit()\n\npd.DataFrame({\n    \"Mean ($) Control\": [mean_c.round(2)],\n    \"Mean ($) Treatment\": [mean_t.round(2)],\n    \"Diff ($)\": [(mean_t-mean_c).round(2)],\n    \"p-value\": [round(ols_con.pvalues['treatment'], 3)]\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage gift size among donors\n\n\n\nMean ($) Control\nMean ($) Treatment\nDiff ($)\np-value\n\n\n\n\n0\n45.540001\n43.869999\n-1.67\n0.561\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGift‐size distribution among donors\n\n\n\n\nTwo histograms drive home the same point. In both the treatment and control arms, most gifts fall below $50, with an occasional larger check beyond $200. The red dashed line in each histogram indicates the average gift, and these lines are nearly indistinguishable, reinforcing that the distribution of gift amounts barely changes when a match is mentioned. Put simply, matching grants boost participation rather than the average gift level.\nCombining these findings with the unconditional revenue result suggests that matching works by widening the donor base, not by persuading existing donors to give more. For fundraisers, this implies that the true value of a match lies in converting potential donors on the fence, while strategies aimed at increasing gift size will likely require different tactics."

By around 5,000 pairs, the estimate already hovers within a few ten-thousandths of the target, and by 10,000 it rarely deviates. This pattern vividly demonstrates the Law of Large Numbers: when observations are independent, the cumulative average locks in on the actual population difference.

Zero is still within the main cluster of data, though it’s no longer centered; chance alone can still yield an estimate near zero, but it’s less common.\nn = 500\nThe spread is noticeably tighter (most simulations land within ±2%). Zero now sits closer to the edge of the distribution’s bulk, so a study of this size would often reject the hypothesis of no effect.\nn = 1,000\nThe curve is sharply peaked and almost perfectly normal. Zero appears far in the left tail; only a small fraction of the 1,000 simulations drift that low. It becomes rare at this sample size to confuse the genuine effect with zero.\n\nTaken together, these snapshots illustrate the Central Limit Theore*: as sample size grows, the distribution of the differences becomes more bell-shaped, and its variance shrinks. Consequently, unlikely values like zero are pushed into the tails, making the true 0.4 percentage-point effect more evident in larger samples."

    "text": "Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a large‑scale field experiment to see whether lowering the price of giving—by announcing a matching grant—boosts charitable donations. In August 2005 they mailed over 50,000 letters to prior supporters of a U.S. civil‑liberties nonprofit and randomly split the sample into a control group and a treatment group.\n\nControl letters looked exactly like the charity’s usual four‑page appeal.\nMatch letters were identical except for one added paragraph on page 2—and bold text on the reply card—announcing that an anonymous “leadership donor” would match any gift received.\n\nWithin the match arm, the researchers orthogonally randomized three design features:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor\nLevels\n\n\n\n\nMatch ratio\n 1:1, 2:1, 3:1\n\n\nMaximum pledge\n $25 k, $50 k, $100 k, or unstated\n\n\nExample ask amount\ndonor’s highest previous gift, 1.25 × that gift, 1.50 × that gift\n\n\n\nThis yielded (3 = 36) distinct match treatments, all printed on otherwise identical stationery.\nThe two primary outcomes were (i) response rate — whether a donor gave within one month—and (ii) dollars contributed. Karlan & List find that any match increases the likelihood of giving by roughly 22 % and the revenue per letter by 19 %, yet higher match ratios (2:1 and 3:1) do not outperform the simple 1:1 offer. :contentReferenceoaicite:0​:contentReferenceoaicite:1\nThis project seeks to replicate their results."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis replication confirms Karlan & List’s core finding: simply telling potential donors their gift will be matched significantly increases participation, while moving from a 1:1 to a 2:1 or 3:1 match does not boost response further or affect average gift size. Randomization checks confirm the treatment and control groups are balanced, so the observed 0.4-percentage-point (≈22%) lift in response rate can be causally linked to the match offer. Probit, linear models, and pairwise t-tests all closely mirror the original paper’s results. The rise in revenue per letter stems mainly from converting more donors, rather than increasing average donation amounts—aligning with the authors’ “figures suggest” observation.\nSimulations of Bernoulli draws illustrate why these conclusions hold: the Law of Large Numbers drives the sample difference toward the true 0.004 effect, and the Central Limit Theorem shows that, with adequate sample size, zero falls to the tails of the sampling distribution. For practitioners, the lesson is straightforward: a one-for-one match captures nearly the full behavioral benefit at minimal cost, indicating that additional resources might be better spent recruiting new donors or targeting bigger gifts through other approaches."
