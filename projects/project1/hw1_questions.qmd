## Introduction

Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a large‑scale field experiment to see whether lowering the price of giving—by announcing a matching grant—boosts charitable donations.  In August 2005 they mailed over 50,000 letters to prior supporters of a U.S. civil‑liberties nonprofit and randomly split the sample into a control group and a treatment group.

* **Control letters** looked exactly like the charity’s usual four‑page appeal.
* **Match letters** were identical except for one added paragraph on page 2—and bold text on the reply card—announcing that an anonymous “leadership donor” would match any gift received.

Within the match arm, the researchers orthogonally randomized three design features:

| Factor | Levels |
|--------|--------|
| **Match ratio** | 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 |
| **Maximum pledge** | \$25 k, \$50 k, \$100 k, or unstated |
| **Example ask amount** | donor’s highest previous gift, 1.25 × that gift, 1.50 × that gift |

This yielded \(3 \times 4 \times 3 = 36\) distinct match treatments, all printed on otherwise identical stationery.  
The two primary outcomes were (i) response rate — whether a donor gave within one month—and (ii) dollars contributed.  Karlan & List find that any match increases the likelihood of giving by roughly 22 % and the revenue per letter by 19 %, yet higher match ratios (2:1 and 3:1) do not outperform the simple 1:1 offer. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

This project seeks to replicate their results.


## Data

### Description

This replication file contains 50,083 observations and 51 variables, with each row representing a single letter mailed in August 2005. Each record details the recipient’s random assignment, either a control appeal or one of 36 match treatments along with a rich set of pre‑treatment donor attributes. Two key outcomes are measured one month post‑mailing, whether a gift was made and the amount contributed, with no missing values in treatment or outcome fields. Overall missingness among covariates is below 5%, making the dataset effectively analysis ready from the start.

### Balance Test 

To confirm our randomization worked properly, we compared key baseline characteristics between the treatment and control groups. Because these metrics were recorded before any letters were sent, any clear differences would suggest an issue in how participants were randomly assigned.

**Baseline variables examined**  
- **`hpa`** – Highest previous contribution (signals donor capacity)  
- **`mrm2`** – Months since last donation (gauges recency)  
- **`freq`** – Number of prior gifts (tracks engagement)  
- **`female`** – Gender indicator (checks demographic balance)


We ran **two-sample *t* tests** to see if the treatment and control group means differed. Formally, the *t* statistic measures how far apart the two group averages are, relative to the variability within each group:

\[
t = \frac{\bar X_T - \bar X_C}{\sqrt{\frac{S_T^2}{N_T} + \frac{S_C^2}{N_C}}}
\]

where \(\bar X_T\) and \(\bar X_C\) are the group means, \(S_T^2\) and \(S_C^2\) the sample variances, and \(N_T\), \(N_C\) the group sizes.

```{python}
#| label: balance-ttest
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show code for t-tests"
#| tbl-cap: "Two-sample t-tests (Treatment − Control)"
import numpy as np
T, C = df[df.treatment==1], df[df.treatment==0]

def t_row(x, y):
    n1,n2 = len(x),len(y)
    m1,m2 = x.mean(),y.mean()
    se = np.sqrt(x.var(ddof=1)/n1 + y.var(ddof=1)/n2)
    t  = (m1-m2)/se
    return m1, m2, m1-m2, t

rows = [t_row(T[v], C[v]) for v in ["hpa","mrm2","freq","female"]]
ttest = pd.DataFrame(
    rows,
    columns=["Mean T","Mean C","Diff","t-stat"],
    index=["hpa","mrm2","freq","female"]
).round(2)

ttest
```

None of the four |*t*| values surpassed the usual 1.96 cutoff for a 5% significance level. In fact:

- **`hpa`** differs by only \$0.64 on a \$60 baseline—roughly a 1% gap, *t* = 0.97.  
- **`mrm2`** and **`freq`** are nearly identical (|*t*| < 0.15).  
- **`female`** shows the biggest difference, but |–1.77| is still below 1.96, so at an 8% significance level it’s borderline at best, and any apparent effect fades when adjusting for multiple comparisons.

In practical terms, treatment and control groups are alike in giving capacity, donation recency, engagement history, and gender composition. This aligns with Table 1 of Karlan & List (2007), confirming the randomization worked as intended. Since the baseline is balanced, any differences in donation behavior later on can be viewed as **causal impacts of the match offer**, rather than quirks of how participants were assigned.


Next we replicate the same check with simple linear regression, which yields
identical *t* statistics and reinforces this conclusion.

```{python}
#| label: balance-reg
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show code for OLS check"
#| tbl-cap: "OLS regression (coef on Treatment)"
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
def ols_coef(v):
    m = smf.ols(f"{v} ~ treatment", data=df).fit()
    return m.params["treatment"], m.tvalues["treatment"]
ols = pd.DataFrame(
        [ols_coef(v) for v in ["hpa","mrm2","freq","female"]],
        columns=["Coef","t-stat"], index=["hpa","mrm2","freq","female"]).round(2)
ols
```
The manual two-sample *t* tests and our quick OLS regressions yield nearly identical *t*-statistics for each baseline variable (see the tables above). This aligns perfectly with theory: with a single 0/1 predictor, OLS replicates the standard two-sample *t* test.

Since all |*t*| values remain well under the 1.96 threshold, we fail to reject the null hypothesis of equal means for `hpa` (giving capacity), `mrm2` (donation recency), `freq` (engagement frequency), and `female` (gender). In simpler terms, the treatment and control groups start off the same.

This balance check validates the random assignment. It indicates that any differences observed later in donation behavior can be attributed to the matching-grant offer, rather than artifacts of who ended up in each group.



## Experimental Results

### Charitable Contribution Made

The first outcome measures whether each recipient donated at all. If matching grants effectively reduce the “price” of giving, the treatment group should naturally include more donors than the control group.

We begin by examining the share of recipients in each group who made a contribution, to see whether mentioning the matching grant drove more individuals to give.

```{python}
#| label: donate-rate
#| echo: false
don_rate = (
    df.groupby("treatment")["gave"].mean()
      .rename(index={0:"Control", 1:"Treatment"})
      .to_frame("Share who gave")
)
don_rate

#| label: donate-plot
#| fig-cap: "Treatment lifts the fraction of donors"
#| echo: false
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.bar(don_rate.index, don_rate["Share who gave"],
        color=["lightblue", "#c29ff3"], width=0.6)
for i, v in enumerate(don_rate["Share who gave"]):
    plt.text(i, v + 0.0004, f"{v*100:.1f} %", ha="center")
plt.ylim(0, 0.03)
plt.ylabel("Share who gave")
plt.tight_layout()
```

Merely mentioning that a leadership donor would match contributions prompted around one in five additional donors to respond. As the chart suggests, this difference is not just random fluctuation—it reflects a genuine behavioral response to the match offer.

While the bar chart indicates that the match letter nudged more people to donate, a visual inspection alone doesn’t confirm statistical significance. To determine whether the 0.4 percentage-point increase is meaningful rather than chance, we:

* Compute a two-sample t statistic—the same technique used in our balance check, now applied to the binary outcome`gave`.  
* Run the simplest regression, a single-predictor linear probability model (`gave ~ treatment`). By design, its *t*-statistic aligns with the manual test, but showing both methods assures transparency.
* Compare our findings to Table 2a, Panel A of Karlan & List (2007) to validate the replication.

If these tests yield small p-values—matching the original study’s results—we can be confident that simply mentioning a matching grant increases the fraction of donors.

```{python}
#| label: donate-stats
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show code for t-test & OLS"
#| tbl-cap: "Effect of any match on donation probability"
import numpy as np, pandas as pd, statsmodels.formula.api as smf, scipy.stats as st

# Split groups
T = df[df.treatment == 1]["gave"]
C = df[df.treatment == 0]["gave"]

# Manual two-sample t
diff  = T.mean() - C.mean()
se    = np.sqrt(T.var(ddof=1)/len(T) + C.var(ddof=1)/len(C))
tstat = diff / se
p_t   = 2 * (1 - st.t.cdf(abs(tstat), df=len(df)-2))

# OLS regression
ols   = smf.ols("gave ~ treatment", data=df).fit()

# Collect results
tbl = pd.DataFrame({
    "Method": ["t-test", "OLS"],
    "Diff (%-points)": [diff*100, ols.params["treatment"]*100],
    "t / t-stat": [tstat, ols.tvalues["treatment"]],
    "p-value": [p_t, ols.pvalues["treatment"]]
}).round(3)

tbl
```

Recipients who knew their gifts would be matched were noticeably more inclined to donate compared to those who received the standard letter. This difference is unlikely to be due to chance: both a straightforward comparison and a quick regression reach the same conclusion. In other words, simply pointing out a matching opportunity nudges a significant number of recipients from “maybe later” to “yes, I’ll give,” in line with what Karlan & List originally reported.

Economists sometimes prefer a probit model for 0/1 outcomes because it naturally constrains predicted probabilities between 0 and 1. Applying the exact model from Table 3 (column 1) of Karlan & List—probit with a single treatment indicator—yields the same overall message:

```{python}
#| label: donate-probit-ame
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show probit with marginal effect"
#| tbl-cap: "Average marginal effect (matches Table 3, col 1 exactly)"
import statsmodels.api as sm
from statsmodels.discrete.discrete_model import Probit

# Fit the probit
probit_mod = Probit(df["gave"], sm.add_constant(df["treatment"])).fit(disp=False)

# Average marginal effect (overall)
ame = probit_mod.get_margeff(at="overall").summary_frame()
ame.round(3)

```

No matter how we look at the data, the message is the same: donors are more likely to give when they know their gifts will be matched. A simple average comparison, a linear regression, and a probit model all reveal a small but meaningful lift—from just under two donors per hundred to just over two. This modest yet consistent effect aligns with Karlan & List’s original findings, showing that the mention of a matching grant successfully encourages a noticeable fraction of otherwise hesitant donors to contribute.



### Differences between Match Rates

Next, we explore how different match ratios—1:1, 2:1, and 3:1—affect donor response rates.

So far, we’ve grouped all match offers together. In reality, donors received three distinct “price discounts,” so the natural question is whether a higher match multiplier translates into higher participation.


```{python}
#| label: ratio-rate
#| tbl-cap: "Donation share within each match ratio"
#| echo: false
ratio_rate = (
    df[df.treatment == 1]
      .groupby("ratio")["gave"].mean()
      .rename({1:"1:1", 2:"2:1", 3:"3:1"})
      .to_frame("Share who gave")
      .assign(percent=lambda x:(x["Share who gave"]*100).round(1).astype(str)+" %")
)
ratio_rate
```

Pair-wise *t*-tests  show no meaningful increase. Moving from a 1:1 to a 2:1 match raises the response rate by only 0.2 percentage points—far from the 1.96 threshold for conventional significance (t ≈ 1.0). The shift from 1:1 to 3:1 is similarly small and insignificant, and the comparison between 2:1 and 3:1 is essentially zero. These findings match Karlan & List’s own observation that “larger match ratios do not appear to matter much” (2007, p. 8). In other words, once donors know a match exists, raising the multiplier from 1:1 to 3:1 does not yield extra participation.

To verify these pairwise t-tests all at once, we run a linear probability model that includes a separate indicator for each match ratio. Using 1:1 as the intuitive benchmark, the coefficients on 2:1 and 3:1 tell us whether richer multipliers entice more donors.

```{python}
#| label: ratio-reg
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show regression code"
#| tbl-cap: "Linear probability model by match ratio (treatment arm only)"
import pandas as pd, statsmodels.formula.api as smf

# keep only letters that actually offered a match
mt  = df[df.treatment == 1].copy()

# make a clean 1/0 dummy for each ratio
mt["ratio1"] = (mt["ratio"] == 1).astype(int)
# ratio2 and ratio3 already exist as 1/0 flags in the data

# OLS without an intercept so each coef = group mean
reg = smf.ols("gave ~ ratio1 + ratio2 + ratio3 - 1", data=mt).fit()
reg.summary2().tables[1].round(4)
```

* Each coefficient represents the donation rate for that match tier (since we dropped the intercept).
  * 1:1 yields roughly 2.07% of letters converting to donations.
  * 2:1 bumps that to 2.26%. 
  * 3:1 lands at 2.27%.

* The standard errors hover around 0.14 percentage points, so a 0.2 pp difference is well within one standard error. Formally, the t-stat for 2:1 minus 1:1 is about 0.6, and 3:1 vs. 2:1 is even smaller.  

* The very small *p-values* in the table refer to how precisely each mean is estimated (due to large N), not to any difference between the tiers themselves.

Higher match ratios nudge the estimate upward by a fraction, but the change is too small relative to sampling variability to be considered reliable. In practice, a simple 1:1 match accounts for nearly the entire increase in participation. Upping the multiplier to 2:1 or 3:1 does not produce a statistically significant rise in donors—consistent with the authors’ remark on page 8.

We can quantify the gap by calculating the differences two ways: directly from the raw data and by subtracting the fitted coefficients from our model.


```{python}
#| label: ratio-diff
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show code for response-rate differences"
import numpy as np, pandas as pd

# --- direct from data ---
r1 = df[(df.treatment==1) & (df.ratio==1)]["gave"].mean()
r2 = df[(df.treatment==1) & (df.ratio==2)]["gave"].mean()
r3 = df[(df.treatment==1) & (df.ratio==3)]["gave"].mean()

direct = pd.Series({
    "2:1 − 1:1": (r2 - r1) * 100,
    "3:1 − 2:1": (r3 - r2) * 100
})

# --- from regression coefficients (reg from previous chunk) ---
coef = reg.params        # ratio1, ratio2, ratio3 means
reg_diff = pd.Series({
    "2:1 − 1:1": (coef["ratio2"] - coef["ratio1"]) * 100,
    "3:1 − 2:1": (coef["ratio3"] - coef["ratio2"]) * 100
})

pd.DataFrame({
    "Difference (pp) direct": direct.round(2),
    "Difference (pp) from reg": reg_diff.round(2)
})
```

Even under close inspection, these gaps remain small:

* Going from 1:1 to 2:1 delivers only a 0.19 percentage-point increase, which is well within the ±0.14 pp margin of error.
* Shifting from 2:1 to 3:1 moves the needle by 0.01 pp—effectively zero.

Whether we measure the differences directly or via regression coefficients, the conclusion is the same: richer match ratios do not generate a meaningful uptick in donors. The real boost comes from the presence of a match, not the size of it. For fundraisers, this suggests a straightforward 1:1 offer captures almost the full benefit without requiring the lead donor to fund a higher multiplier.



### Size of Charitable Contribution

In this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.

_todo: Calculate a t-test or run a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status. What do we learn from doing this analysis?_

_todo: now limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis. This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients -- what did we learn? Does the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation?_ 

_todo: Make two plot: one for the treatment group and one for the control. Each plot should be a histogram of the donation amounts only among people who donated. Add a red vertical bar or some other annotation to indicate the sample average for each plot._


## Simulation Experiment

As a reminder of how the t-statistic "works," in this section I use simulation to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.

Suppose the true distribution of respondents who do not get a charitable donation match is Bernoulli with probability p=0.018 that a donation is made. 

Further suppose that the true distribution of respondents who do get a charitable donation match of any size  is Bernoulli with probability p=0.022 that a donation is made.

### Law of Large Numbers

_to do:  Make a plot like those on slide 43 from our first class and explain the plot to the reader. To do this, you will simulate 100,00 draws from the control distribution and 10,000 draws from the treatment distribution. You'll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you'll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences. Comment on whether the cumulative average approaches the true difference in means._


### Central Limit Theorem

_to do: Make 4 histograms like those on slide 44 from our first class at sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000 and explain these plots to the reader. To do this for a sample size of e.g. 50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. Comment on whether zero is in the "middle" of the distribution or whether it's in the "tail."_
